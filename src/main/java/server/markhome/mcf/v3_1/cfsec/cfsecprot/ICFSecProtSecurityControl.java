 *	used by the system to tell registered caches what information to forget about, including
 *	users, permission groups, tenants, clusters, or the entire cache of information. Application logic

	 *	Forget about the specified lists of objects.  Any null arguments are presumed to imply empty sets.
	 *	Caches keep concurrent hash maps of user login strings and user ids mapped to a common internal
	 *	userinfo object that maintains the caches for the user, one each for the system, the cluster, and
	 *	the tenant security probes. Each such cache is a map by permission name string.  For the system
	 *	cache, this map has Boolean data for the true/false state of the cached permission.  For the cluster
	 *	cache, this map has a sub-map of cluster ids which reference the Booleans.  Similarly, the tenant id
	 *	sub-maps reference Booleans.
	 *
	 *	The userinfo objects also track the last time the user's security information was queried, allowing for
	 *	a pruning scan to automatically expire stale, unused data should the user wander away from their sessions.
	 *
	 *	There is no "global" cache of default permissions applying to all users or anything like that, just per-user permission
	 *	caching.
